ROT13 ("rotate by 13 places", usually hyphenated ROT-13) is a simple Caesar cipher used for obscuring text by replacing each letter with the letter thirteen places down the alphabet. A becomes N, B becomes O, and so on up to M, which becomes Z, then the sequence reverses: N becomes A, O becomes B, and so on to Z, which becomes M. The algorithm is used in online forums as a means of hiding joke punchlines, puzzle solutions, movie and story spoilers, and offensive materials from the casual glance. ROT13 has been described as the " Usenet equivalent of a magazine printing the answer to a quiz upside down" . The name "ROT13" originated on Usenet in the early 1980s, and the method has become a de facto standard. As a Caesar cipher (a method of encryption thousands of years old), ROT13 provides no real cryptographic security and is not used for such; in fact it is often used as the canonical example of weak encryption. An additional feature of the cipher is that it is symmetrical; that is, to undo ROT13, the same algorithm is applied, so the same code can be used for encoding and decoding.
